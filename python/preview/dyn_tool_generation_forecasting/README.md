# Forecasting with Self-Improving Agents (Tool Generation at Runtime)

This module contains code for forecasting sales data using an AI agent that creates tools during runtime based on data analysis. It provides a framework for loading sales data, invoking forecasting models, and evaluating the results.

## Usage
To use this module, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run the main script to start the forecasting process.
3. Evaluate the results using the provided evaluation function.

To test the code generation delete the contents of the `sources/dynamic_tools` folder.

## ToDo
- Analyze why the prediction for product c is wrong.
- Explore alternative forecasting models.
- Data generation and evaluation should be more flexible for other prediciton days than 21
- Test with noisy data
- Test with periodic data
