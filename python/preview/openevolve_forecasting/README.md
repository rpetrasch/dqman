# View results
- Folder openevolve_output: Original output (checkpoints, logs, programs) 
- Not perfect, but interesting visualization: python evolution_analyzer.py
  - produces a png file for every non-empty island
  - marks the best of one branch with a green circle
  - marks the global best (in island 0) with a yellow circle
  - marks programs with a score lower then 0.1 in red
- Folder implementations: This directory contains some implementations of the sales forecasters generated by OpenEvolve.
  - Is is just a demonstration of some program versions.
  - If you want to run one of them, copy them into the project root and run the file.
