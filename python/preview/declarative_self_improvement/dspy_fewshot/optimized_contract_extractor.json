        "reasoning": "I scanned the agreement for the key clauses. The opening paragraph lists the parties and their legal designations, which provides the names for the “parties” field. The phrase “made and entered into as of 05/08/2014” gives the agreement date, and the same date is repeated as the commencement date in section 1, giving the effective date. Section 1 also states the agreement will continue until 12/31/2014, so that is the expiration date. The renewal clause specifies “additional periods of one year each,” which I translated into a renewal term of 1 year. The notice requirement for non‑renewal is “at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term,” yielding a 30‑day notice period. Finally, the governing law clause cites the State of Nevada. All dates are already in US format, so no conversion is necessary.",
