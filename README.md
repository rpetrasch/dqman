## Repo structure
- We use different programming languages and frameworks so in the future we will probably split up the repo.
- For now, the Java modules can be build with Maven, the Python code modules are in the subfolder python.
- Some examples require Docker and Docker compose

## Detailed information 
- Each example should have its own README.md (sorry, if this is currently not yet the case)
